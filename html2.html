Hope is a capacity to have an optimistic point of view on any circumstance. 
<br>For instance, given that we are in the midst of pandemic, one is hopeful if he/she believes that humanity can get through this heavy situation. 
<br>My drawing portrays the hand reaching out for hope that is the dove. 
<br>The hand is the symbol for humanity trying to grasp on the silver lining. 
<br>Because of all of the challenges to day, people are just try to grab on what ever they can just to have hope. 
<br>For me, this is my understanding about the word hope.
