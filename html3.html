We're not losing any hope more than we have now, we must now take action. 
<br>No matter how many times we fail, we must never lose our stance. 
<br>May it be defensive or attack, we must never give up, no matter how hard or how many times we must experience the same sour defeat. 
<br>We will reach, that end for the better with our gleaming hope. 
<br>I drew a flower standing on a withered land, to represent our struggle of surviving and losing no hope whatsoever. 
<br>Because our struggles and hard work will bloom at the end.
