no matter what the calamity or problem is. We should not lose 
<br>hope or give up on something. Because Every calamity has an end and every problem has its own 
<br>solution. I made this dove drawing because it symbolizes how it spreads its wings. When the dove has faced lots of calamities and problems. On how it learned to fly 
<br>with its own wings.
